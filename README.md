# Email/SMS Spam Classifier

This project is an Email/SMS Spam Classifier application built using Python and Streamlit. The goal of this project is to classify messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam) based on the content of the message. The model has been trained on a dataset of labeled messages, and it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data before making predictions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **Streamlit Application**: A user-friendly interface for entering and classifying messages.
- **Text Preprocessing**: A function that cleans and preprocesses the input text to make it suitable for classification.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A pre-trained model that predicts whether a message is spam or ham.
- **Vectorizer**: Converts text data into numerical format (Bag of Words) for the model to process.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user enters a message (SMS or Email) into the text box provided in the Streamlit app.
2. **Preprocessing**: The message is processed using NLP techniques:
   - The text is converted to lowercase.
   - Tokenization is applied to split the text into individual words.
   - Non-alphanumeric characters and stopwords are removed.
   - The words are stemmed to their root forms using the Porter Stemmer.
3. **Vectorization**: The cleaned text is then transformed into a numerical format using a pre-trained `CountVectorizer`.
4. **Prediction**: The vectorized text is fed into the pre-trained model, which outputs a prediction:
   - `Spam`: The message is classified as spam.
   - `Ham`: The message is classified as not spam.
5. **Output**: The result is displayed on the Streamlit app.

## Example Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Enter a message in the provided text area.

3. Click the "Predict" button to check if the message is spam or not.

Example messages you can try:

- "Congratulations! You've won a free ticket to the Bahamas. Call now!"
- "Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?"

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the project:

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install scikit-learn
pip install nltk
```

Additionally, the NLTK data packages `punkt` and `stopwords` need to be downloaded. This is handled in the script as follows:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Files

- `app.py`: The main script that runs the Streamlit app.
- `model.pkl`: The pre-trained machine learning model for spam classification.
- `vectorizer.pkl`: The pre-trained `CountVectorizer` used for transforming text data into numerical format.

## Preprocessing Function

The text preprocessing function used in both training and prediction is defined as follows:

```python
def text_transform(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = nltk.word_tokenize(text)

    y = []
    for i in text:
        if i.isalnum():
            y.append(i)

    text = y[:]
    y.clear()

    for i in text:
        if i not in stopwords.words('english') and i not in string.punctuation:
            y.append(i)

    text = y[:]
    y.clear()

    for i in text:
        y.append(ps.stem(i))

    return " ".join(y)
```

## Model Training

The model was trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages using common text classification techniques. The training process included:

- **Text Preprocessing**: As described above.
- **Vectorization**: Converting text to a Bag of Words representation.
- **Model Selection**: A machine learning algorithm was selected and trained on the preprocessed data.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Model**: Consider using more advanced models like TF-IDF or deep learning techniques for better accuracy.
- **Email Classification**: Extend the classifier to handle emails more effectively.
- **Real-time API**: Deploy the model as an API for real-time spam detection.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques and machine learning to classify messages as spam or ham. The Streamlit app provides an easy-to-use interface for testing the classifier with real-world examples.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or extend the project. Happy coding!
